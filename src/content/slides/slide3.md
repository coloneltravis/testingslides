The quality of a software product can be measured by:-

- Number of defects found.
- Number of failures in a specific time period.
- Usability assessment.
- Maintainability


Testing provides confidence in software if it finds few no defects.

The overall level of risk is reduced when well-designed tests are passed.

When defects are fixed, the quality of the software increases.
